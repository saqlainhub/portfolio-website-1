# Awesome Portfolio Website Practice
This portfolio website is a personal project created as part of my learning journey. It's a practice clone where I honed my skills and gained valuable insights into modern web development. While inspired by an existing design, I've added unique touches and refinements that showcase my ability to build even better and fully original websites. My goal is to ensure viewers see creativity, capability, and potential in my work rather than a mere replication.

I created this website on <b>September 2024</b> , as a role in <b>Coding</b>.
